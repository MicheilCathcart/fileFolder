# FileFolder

This project allows you to create nested files and folders in a tree structure. I added a parent reference on the node model to make it easier to track what array nodes where getting deleted from or added too. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Issues

I could not build the application `ng build` at this point due to an issue with angular cli. Please see https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22606 for the fix. Removing the line "last 2 Safari major versions" from the file .browserslistrc fixed this issue for me.

## External Code

I have borrowed a create GUID function and a function that removes the parent property on the NodeModel when exporting to JSON, this is so the JSON can render for display and not fail due to circular dependecies.

## Improvements that could be made

1. More feedback should be given to the user when focussing on inputs.
1. Tidy up common CSS elements
1. Make it responsive
1. Improve icons to be more in line with the actions
